As they warm up and talk about life, the girls navigate the politics of their personal lives as well as the politics of the larger world, gossiping about things like war, menstrual products, genocide, sports, pop culture, and their relationships. Each team member struggles to negotiate her individuality while being a part of a group. They bond over a bag of orange slices and personal traumas. The team seems as if it may disband after the sudden death of one of the girls, but they manage to come together. In the end, the surviving team players pre- pare to play yet another game together – closer, stronger, wiser, and fiercer. </div>
