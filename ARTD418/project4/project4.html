  <h1 style="font-size: 30px;  color: white; font-family: American Typerwriter, monospace; width: 60%; padding-top: 165px;"> Introduction</h1>

  <p style="width: 42%; padding-bottom: 175px; opacity: 50%">In the country of Mexico, there are many people that are suffering from hunger throughout the states. About 8.5 million residents of Mexico need to live on less than $2 a day. This number is significantly high even though there is not much being said about it. Hunger affects many people of different age groups across the states of Mexico. Why does this matter? Many people are suffering from hunger, and it is a problem that many people have to worry about each day. Hunger should not be a problem that people need to worry about everyday since there are already many issues that people have to worry about. A solution must be found to help prevent hunger. Through this site, I hope that there can be more awareness brought to this issue so that we can help solve it together. </p>
        
        
<h1 style="font-size: 30px;  color: white; font-family: American Typerwriter, monospace; width: 60%; padding-top: 300px;"> What is Hunger?</h1>
        <div style="background-image: url(images/brown-wheat-under-blue-sky-162769.jpg); background-size: 600px; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: right; opacity: 50%;">
  <p style="width: 40%; padding-bottom: 175px;">Hunger brings a lot of uncomfortable or painful physical sensations because of the lack of consumption of dietary energy. Without the proper foods, hunger can become chronic and can affect the daily lives of people. The lack of consumption can interfere with people’s daily habits such as preventing them from having enough energy to do tasks such as exercise or any physical work. Without the proper consumption of food, people will lack the nutrition they need and become weaker. It affects many parts of the human body system and can lead to eating disorders where people will either eat too much or too little of food. Today, it is estimated that over 820 million people are going hungry. For decades, FAO has used the Prevalence of Undernourishment indicator to estimate the extent of chronic hunger in the world, thus “hunger” may also be referred to as undernourishment.

<h1 style="font-size: 30px;  color: white; font-family: American Typerwriter, monospace; width: 60%; padding-top: 165px;"> Main Cause of Hunger: Poverty</h1>
        <div style="background-image: url(images/bernardo-ramonfaur-obLuRD6DZOo-unsplash.jpg); background-size: 600px; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: right; opacity: 50%;">
  <p style="width: 40%; padding-bottom: 175px;">Mexico has suffered from the effects of poverty and food insecurity for decades. The problem does not lie in food unavailability but in the fact that areas living in poverty do not make enough money to purchase necessary goods. Mexico is experiencing an unbalanced distribution of wealth where the richest part of the population has nearly 14 times more money than the poorest one. As different social classes have different access to food the main problem with food insecurity is accessibility, not availability. At least 10 percent of all residents of Mexico experience poor access to food, while the inadequate food access affects between 25 and 35 percent of the population in nine states.</p>

    <div style="background-image: url(images/architecture-building-catholic-church-415611.jpg); background-size: 650px; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: right; opacity: 50%;">
        
  <p style="width: 40%; padding-bottom: 80px;">Because of hunger, Mexico suffers from issues with malnutrition, anemia, overweight and obesity. The rates of malnutrition have dropped significantly but about 13 percent of children under the age of 5 suffer from malnutrition and one in four children is overweight or obese. Rates of malnutrition are highest in rural areas and obesity is highest in urban areas. According to data acquired by the National Survey of Wholesale, Food and Nutritional Status in Rural Areas  (ENAAEN), all food groups for a healthy diet were available for sale within the communities. The problem is that residents do not have sufficient income to purchase all the goods they need. From the lack of a proper diet, people have to also to worry about their health which is really important for one's life. With many concerns, families decide to focus mainly on going to work and most times children end up dropping out of school because they also want to go into the work field. However without the proper education, you cannot find a suitable job to make enough money. In addition to these concerns not living a healthy life can lead to other issues such as inefficiency in work and problems arising with death, people become more vulnerable and are not able to perform as well as others which can really affect their health. This is why stressing the importance of the affects of hunger are really important.

 <h1 style="font-size: 30px;  color: white; font-family: American Typerwriter, monospace; width: 60%; padding-top: 165px;"> Solution</h1>
     <div style="background-image: url(images/etty-fidele-oJpkjWcScyg-unsplash.jpg); background-size: 650px; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: right; opacity: 50%;">
        
  <p style="width: 40%; padding-bottom: 150px;">In order to help solve this issue of hunger, organizations are doing their best to help people by providing services for issues that help people from staying out of poverty. Some of those services include education programs to help people in learning so that they can find more sustainable work for kids and adults. This method is very important because people often are not able to get educated enough to work in higher position jobs. In addition to these programs, organizations also provide meals and donations to help feed as many people that are suffering from hunger. This is very helpful to those that struggle with hunger so that they can have food when they cannot afford it. Overall the help provided by these programs is very significant for the people struggling with hunger.
