  <p style="width: 42%; padding-bottom: 100px;">Microfinance is a powerful self-help support tool that allows the very poor to reduce the day-to-day uncertainties of cash management. Whether it is saving money or gaining access to credit, vital needs can be met and opportunities pursued. Since 1988, Freedom from Hunger has developed and promoted “value-added" or “integrated" microfinance programs that pair financial services with other important development services, such as education and health protection. They continue to innovate with self-managed savings groups that enable outreach to very rural areas.

         <div style="background-image: url(https://www.thp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Oaxaca-Leadership2-e1464882309908.jpg); background-size: 600px; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: right; opacity: 50%;">
  <p style="width: 42%; padding-bottom: 50px;">The Hunger Project is playing a leadership role in transforming the current situation for rural communities in Mexico. We are pioneering comprehensive, bottom-up, women-centered strategies for rural progress in four states in Mexico — including two of the poorest, Chiapas and Oaxaca.
Over the past 30 years, The Hunger Project’s experience in Mexico has demonstrated that the most direct and lasting route to sustainable development — to ending hunger — is through the will, commitment and capacity of the people who stand to gain the most when hunger ends: the hungry people themselves.

Through a phased approach, The Hunger Project-Mexico starts with mobilizing villages and communities through capacity building and Vision, Commitment and Action (VCA) workshops. Either at the community or family level, partners create their own vision for the future, commit to achieving it, and outline the actions that are needed to succeed. Actions to succeed include opportunities to learn how to plan, implement and evaluate small-scale projects that will effect change within their families or villages. Coming soon: Read more about mobilization throughout The Hunger Project’s 12 Program Countries.
